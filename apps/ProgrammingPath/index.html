	How to Become a Web Developer
	</h1>
	<body>
	
		<p>
		So you want to be a web developer? Well, you need to know HTML, CSS, and Javascript for sure. 
		If you're going to make stuff on the web, you're definitely going to use those. These technologies 
		are how people create the front ends of web applications. HTML and CSS are good ones to start with because they are
		easier than Javascript or any of the other programming languages you will use on the back end of your app. I tried to jump into 
		server side languages after learning only the tiniest bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and it was pretty frustrating. So I went back to the basics
		and made this app.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It's when you get to the back end that things get interesting. There are tons of choices. Some popular
		languages right now are Python and Ruby.
		
		So, which do you want to use?

		Alright, now, would you say you're more of an independent learner or a person that benefits from structure?
