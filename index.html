          Hi, I'm Coleman Foley. I was born and raised in Marysville, CA, a small town in Northern California. I recently moved to San Francisco to attend <a href="http://hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, an intensive front-end web development course. I've been blogging about my experiences learning to program on my <a href="http://learningtocode.quora.com/">blog</a></br>on Quora.
          I'm very interested in how the web is changing music consumption, particularly music discovery. I'm fascinated by content discovery in general.

            This was my personal project at Hack Reactor. It's basically Quora for music recommendations. You ask for music recommendations on a certain theme, then others can search for songs to add, getting back search results from Rdio. Then, when you browse answers to questions, you can play the songs through the Rdio API.

            This was the first complete, working page I made outside of my personal website. It is a very basic guide to learning web development. As you make choices about what technology you want to learn and what you learning style is, it updates.
